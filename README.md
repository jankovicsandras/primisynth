# Primisynth

Experimental synthesizer and loop generator

### Version 0.1.0
### This is a work in progress.

As you might guess from the name, this is not the most advanced music software ever. It's an experimental toy, made for (self) educational purposes.

## PROs

- free
- small, single file synth and sequencer
- no trigonometry, FFT or other "advanced" math, just quadratic splines and linear interpolation
- works in the browser or with Node.js

## CONs

- no trigonometry, FFT or other "advanced" math, just quadratic splines and linear interpolation
- not real time
- creates only relatively short sounds, not a full DAW
- buggy UI, TODO
- no documentation, TODO
- possibly incorrect musical terms, TODO
